        <h1>Study Background</h1>
        <p>Music is a big part of many people’s lives, and through the data set we have collected,  we can see how much of life music really affects. Specifically, we can find how much a person’s anxiety is affected by the type of music they listen to and how much they listen to everyday. While researching, we came across a data set that contained many helpful bits of information about this topic. The individuals in this data set are people who listen to music during their day-to-day activities, while the variables include the ages of the participants, how often they listen to music per day in hours, their favorite genre of music, and their anxiety levels on a numerical scale of 1-10.
        <br><br>The data was collected by use of a Google Form that was disseminated through many social media platforms and even advertised in public locations by the data collectors. The survey itself was made brief by the people gathering data for the survey to be easily answerable, and they got 700+ responses in a day due to this. The dataset is considered to be a population as the data collectors collected as many responses as possible. For our qualitative variables, we have the participants’ tastes in music and their anxiety levels, which are nominal and ordinal variables respectfully. And for our quantitative data, we have their ages, which are measured in years, and how much they listen to music, which is measured in hours per day.
