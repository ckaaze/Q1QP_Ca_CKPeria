                <p>In these graphs, a pie chart and a bar graph respectively, the genre with the biggest piece of the pie is the Rock genre, with 188 responses, meaning that a huge number of the respondents listen to rock music. Meanwhile, the genre with the least responses is Latin music, with only 3 responses, meaning that only a very small percentage of the respondents listen to Latin music.</p>

                <p>In these graphs, a pie chart and a bar graph respectively, the anxiety level that had the most answers was level 7, with 122 respondents, which can mean that a lot of the survey respondents are very anxious. The anxiety level with the least answers was level 7.5 , with only 1 respondent, which can mean that only this particular respondent is slightly more anxious than the people with anxiety level 7.</p>

            <p id="summary">Based on the summary of statistics presented above, we can observe that 26% of the respondents’ favorite genre is rock. 188 out of 736 respondents like this genre. In contrast, only 3 out of 736 respondents like Latin music. If we observe the anxiety levels of the respondents, 17% of them fall under anxiety level 7 and only one person falls under anxiety level 7.5. But how exactly does music affect an individual? Based on the data that we have obtained; we can observe that anxiety levels are much higher among individuals that listen to rock. Age can also play a part in an individual’s anxiety levels, here we can observe that individuals are most likely to have a high anxiety level if they are in their late teens. 
                Studies show that music can impact our mood long-term, increasing depression or anxiety. Certain songs, lyrics, or genres of music are more likely to intensify these feelings. It is possible that if we listen to songs that have intense emotion, it may trigger anxiety. If an individual finds themselves to be more anxious and less relaxed, it may be because of the genre of music that they listen to. It would be recommended to try a different genre of music and see how it affects them. Certain genres of music, such as classical, soft pop, and certain types of world music contain the musical elements that are necessary to help a person relax. According to ASCAP,  listening to music can help calm your nervous system and lower cortisol levels, both of which can help reduce stress. Music can be a form of emotional release, it can be a way for an individual to express themselves and let their feelings out. In this way, music can help an individual’s anxiety, but it can also make it worse. </p>
